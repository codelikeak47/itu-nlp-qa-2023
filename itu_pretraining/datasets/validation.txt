momentum mom based and cst microwave studio tlm based . although, these simulators are based on different em techniques still have produced acceptable simulation results for antennas in comparison with their respective measured results as expected. download pdf quick links home publications contact us faculty profile: dr. muhammad qasim mehmood faculty profile: dr. muhammad zubair faculty profile: dr. kashif riaz useful links metamaterials plasmonic research laboratory prof. ricky ang's group sutd singapore prof. shuang zhang university of birmingham rice online learning spietv prof. v. shalaev purdue university socialize 2019 information technology university, government of the punjab powered by: information technology university

auto manufacturing to healthcare. the undergraduate students of itu are focusing on bringing pakistan forward in this dynamic field. the objective of this exhibition was to help students apply their classroom takeaways and develop a culture of high tech innovation and practical research. under the supervision of course instructor talha rehmani, itu students were able to show demos of their robots and make websites, technical reports and write ups. the event also showcased the project of 9 year old child prodigy, muhammad raza, who displayed his color sensing and beacon following robot. during the exhibition, itu students showcased various robots that may be useful in solving locally relevant problems in pakistan. a team of students showcased their robotic stick for carbon emission control to control carbon monoxide emissions. a main source of carbon monoxide is by vehicular emission. according to the national conservation strategy report, 25 tonnes of carbon monoxide is released from vehicles in pakistan, so itu students built this robotic stick to address this prevalent problem. the sensor has to be held near the vehicle silencer for 2.5 minutes and then it gives out the result in volts. another invention showcased by the students of the electronic devices and circuits class was geekbot. geekbot is a statically balancing biped robot. it can walk autonomously, avoid obstacles, and statically balance itself ensuring it does not fall. the team who built this robot found that synchronizing both legs of the robots presented a challenge but they were able to overcome this difficulty. students also used this occasion to address the global issue of landmine removal. a group of students built demining robot which has the capacity to respond when it senses a metallic object in its path. it can detect an object if it s up to 40 cm away from the detector, and it buzzes and flashes a red beam as a warning if it detects a metal of substantial size in its path. each robotic invention

was assessed by a panel of judges according to its innovation and or navigational consistency. the panel of esteemed judges awarded first place to the makers of geekbot, with second place going to the team who built object identifier and collector robot. third place was awarded to the team who built the robotic stick for carbon emission control. the chief guest of the exhibition, prof. dr. b.s. chowdhry, renowned scientist and ict expert, spoke at the event and praised itu students for their outstanding efforts in robotics. the honorary guests also included prof. dr. arshad ali, principal of the school of electrical engineering and computer science at nust. the event was widely attended by the faculty and rectors of many prestigious universities including nust, lums and fast. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

function. this technique shows a viable solution to discriminate the oam of light at the nano scale and might lead to broad benefits across the fields of optical communications, plasmonic physics and singular optics. download pdf quick links home publications contact us faculty profile: dr. muhammad qasim mehmood faculty profile: dr. muhammad zubair faculty profile: dr. kashif riaz useful links metamaterials plasmonic research laboratory prof. ricky ang's group sutd singapore prof. shuang zhang university of birmingham rice online learning spietv prof. v. shalaev purdue university socialize 2019 information technology university, government of the punjab powered by: information technology university

he added. government of punjab founded the punjab information technology board pitb in 1999 as an autonomous body to leverage synergies in the it industry, academic institutions, and government organizations. pitb monitors global opportunities, caters to the growing needs of it, develops policy alternatives, as well as plans and rapidly implements initiatives for building an internationally competitive it industry in the province, with the goal of enabling the country to achieve its it potential. the legacy decentralized it infrastructure of the punjab government departments was not only expensive in terms of maintenance and operations but also was less efficient, no disaster recovery options, and wasn t easy to maintain. punjab it board first of all centralized the it infrastructure by establishing a centralized datacenter and eliminating the distributed small inefficient datacenters thereby not only saving costs in terms of power and resources but also minimized the downtime and ensured the reliability of the services. initially, pitb data center was designed to run on traditional technology in which 90 of processing capacity remained unutilized resulting in inefficient usage of resources. the system was also unpredictable and faced scalability issues in terms of system and network resources, as it was unable to deploy and deliver new services quickly or effectively due to extensive manual processes for the provisioning of new services. envisioning and responding to the changes in technology, growing demands of information technology it in pakistan and to empower government departments by focusing on innovation, the punjab information technology board pitb being the first entity in pakistan has embarked on a digital and cloud transformation journey with vmware to transform its it infrastructure, resulting in achieving nimbleness, elasticity and performance to better serve technology stakeholders in the country. pitb deployed vmware with nsx to achieve a highly secure,

fully robust, controlled and efficient solution to meet the challenges. the solution reduced the provisioning time for new services from days to seconds, increased the efficiency of resources by 10 times and improved operational efficiency through automation. pitb being the central hub for the highly sensitive and critical electronic services of government of punjab as well as for some of federal departments, carried out the transformation from legacy infrastructure environment to completely virtualized cloud infrastructure without any loss or outage of running services which itself stands for a big achievement. moreover, the aftersales support and technical help, provided by vmware through its local and us based customer success team, contributed to the successful deployment, reaffirming pitb s trust in vmware as a partner. the new state of the art vmware based virtualized cloud infrastructure embedded with the security through integrated virtualized firewall services has enabled faster and robust deployment and delivery of new services with complete isolation, security and visibility of applications and services in a controlled environment with highly optimized disaster recovery operations, reducing the recovery times from days and hours to minutes and seconds. with the usage of dynamic inclusion policies that are context aware, security is also now intrinsic in pitb s data center. some of numerous flagship pitb initiatives that have improved and benefited from higher availability and performance include: the smart monitoring of public school data, e stamping and the punjab public management reform program. capacity planning reports can now be developed in just matter of minutes. pitb is able to roll out applications for new services quickly and in a predictable manner. pitb is now able to anticipate data center performance and respond with better and more robust business decisions. pitb is now looking to run a complete vmware private cloud solution to better serve

both internal and external stakeholders. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

the last year or so me and adviser have introduced concept decsontructive learning . one of the problem that kept intriguing me was discovering an object automatically from the set of images. we explored the problem with respect to the multi image co segmentation . i explored sparse represnetation and dictionary learning to specifically see how it could be used for image classification. we introduced part wise affine constraints that could handle images with noise and or occlusion. selected publications are listed here . deconstructive learning pdf project page we introduced the novel notion of deconstructive learning and proposed a practical computational framework for deconstructing a broad class of binary classifiers commonly used in computer vision applications. while the ultimate objective of most learning problems is the determination of classifiers from labeled training data, for deconstructive learning, the objects of study are the classifiers themselves. as its name suggests, the goal of deconstructive learning is to deconstruct a given classifier by determining and characterizing as much as possible the full extent of its capability, revealing all of its powers, subtleties and limitations. in particular, this problem is motivated by the seemingly innocuous question that given an image based binary classifier c as a black box oracle, how much can we learn of its internal working by simply querying it multi image cosegmentation i am working on the problem of multi image co segmentation, segmenting out object similar in the given set of images . two important words here are object and the similar . previous works have looked into the problem by segmenting out similar region and have defined similar to be similarity in color. this similarity is represented as energy function and problem is formulated as engergy minimization problem. such a structure does not allow more control over what we want to be segment out. we, on the other hand, are iterested in segmenting

out object that might have similar color, shape or structure. for this we segment out each image at different speed, easy images get segmented out much faster than complex images images with many objects and texture and then after each iteration share information about the images. thus helping segment out complex images from information we have gathered from the easy images. dictionary learning and sparse representation worked on the problem of dictionary learning w.r.t sparse representation of data. we explored use of block and group structures and introduced affine constraints for image classification. this work resulted in publications listed below. x previous next recent publications deconstructing kernel machines mohsen ali, muhammad rushdi, and jeffrey ho european conference on machine learning and principles and practice of knowledge discovery in databases, 2014 pdf project page affine constrained group sparse coding and its application to image based classification mohsen ali, yu tseh chi, muhammad rushdi, and jeffrey ho proceedings of ieee international conference on computer vision iccv 2013 block and group regularized sparse modeling for dictionary learning yu tseh chi, mohsen ali, ajit rajwade, and jeffrey ho proceedings of ieee conference on computer vision and pattern recognition cvpr 2013 color de rendering using coupled dictionary learning muhammad rushdi, mohsen ali, jeffrey ho 20th ieee international conference on image processing icip 2013 awards honors affiliations students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering

after dipping our toes in deep belief networks and recurrent neural network we will start looking into applications of deep learning in three different areas, text analysis, speech processing and computer vision. objective of this approach is to make you comfortable enough that you can understand various research problems and, if interested, can implement deep learning based applications. course objectives in last few years machine learning has matured from the science fiction to reality. we are living in a world where we have already seen industry bringing to reality self driving cars, face recognizers that work on massive scale facebook , speech translation systems that can translate from one language to many other simultaneously and in real time, and more interestingly we have machines that can learn to play atari games in a similar fashion like we do. a lot of these victories have come from the exciting field of deep learning a learning methodology based on the concept that human mind captures details at multiple levels or at multiple abstract levels. one property of deep learning is removing the responsibility of humans to design features, instead deep learning is given a task to find the appropriate representation. grading policy 50 assignments 15 final project 15 quizzes 10 midterm exam 10 final exam honor code all cases of academic misconduct will be forwarded to the disciplinary committee. all assignments are group based unless explicitly specified by the instructor. in the words of efros,let s not embarrass ourselves. tentative and rough course outline weeks topics evaluations 1 introduction to deep learning difference between machine learning and deep learning basic machine learning: linear logistic regression, 2 supervised learning with neural networks deep learning, single and multi layer neural networks, perceptron rule, gradient descent, backpropagation, loss functions tutorial 1: python numpy tutorial assignment 1 1 hyperparameters tuning, regularization

method which could be employed in the school, understanding that teaching methods need to include the component of visualization to make learning easier and reduce the cognitive load on young children s minds. having gotten hold of a single, roofless room, orakzai s next step was to rebuild the roof with the help of his friends. he also hired a female teacher who was nominally educated. the main role of this teacher was to play the interactive curriculum on a projector, and answer any questions the students may have. the results were phenomenal. not only were students learning fast they were also adapting extremely well to the technology driven approach. the students ended up completing the year long course in only four months! the main hurdle faced by such projects is of sustainability. to ensure that teachers remain on their job, orakzai has devised an interesting incentive. he offers teachers the ownership of the program provided laptop if they continue working for two years straight. the school has reduced the fee for female students by half to encourage families to educate their daughters as well as their sons. the one room school project has found traction within the local society and is currently expanding. this project illustrates how simple and innovative solutions which combine technology and pedagogy can be used to overcome educational challenges which have plagued the country s rural areas for decades. as one of the core missions of information technology university is to train bright minds to solve pakistan s problems, itu s department itu trainings organized a week long designing interactive learning applications workshop which participants were encouraged to come up with such ideas. the workshop proved to be a successful platform for innovators, pedagogues and technologists to engage in meaningful collaborations. itu hopes that such ventures and training paltforms will be instrumental in encouraging people to take initiative like faheem orakzai and become

heidelberg during a talk organized by lahore astronomical society las in collaboration with information technology university itu on, the search for life in the solar system. a question perplexed humankind for decades is whether we are alone in the universe. if we are not, what does extraterrestrial life look like and where does it reside in the talk dr. nozair khawaja spoke about the current research in the field of astrobiology. the talk focused an overview of the current research in the field of astrobiology the search for life in space, to look for extraterrestrial life in the solar system in search of water, an energy source and organic molecules on other planetary bodies. until the 1990 s, it was claimed that there is no liquid water except on earth. however, the galileo and cassini huygens space missions have changed this prevailing view. liquid water is suspected on jupiter s moon europa and found on saturn s moon enceladus, where the surface temperature is below 100 c. liquid water exists in the form of oceans lying under icy crusts of these moons. with the discovery of icy plumes on enceladus, the general view on the habitability of the outer solar system has changed. the cassini huygens mission analyzed the composition of icy grains ejected from the moon and discovered the subsurface salty oceans, organic compounds, hydrothermal activity and tidal heat as an energy source. these discoveries have made enceladus a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life in the solar system. future space missions are currently in the preparation phase to look for signs of extraterrestrial microbial life on europa and enceladus. osaid alam shah, a student of bs computer science at itu, commented that, the lecture catered to the mainstream audience who mostly had little or no prior knowledge of astronomy. another student of bs electrical engineering at itu, abdul moeed commented that, the talk added to our knowledge, especially the fact that signs of life have been detected

on the moons of the outer planets of our solar system. lahore astronomical society last was founded in 1995 by a small group of amateur astronomers and is now the leading amateur astronomical society in pakistan, which is actively and consistently involved in public outreach, education, and scientific research, all of which are free of cost. a large number of people from different walks of life including the core members of lahore astronomical society, the planetary society and the students of itu attended this session. for further details contact: aamna saleem cell phone: 92 323 841 0523 email: saleem.aamna@gmail.com facebook: www.facebook.com groups lahoreastronomy x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

the approach to rank the quality of universities research done through bibliometric indexes of quality and volume of research will consider such integrated departments as a term of comparison. this method will not take into consideration a university in the developing world which may not have such an integrated department or comprehensive strengths overall as an institution, but might well be doing excellent research in, say, the sub field of artificial intelligence. to create recognition about niche research strengths, itu s scientometrics lab, under the patronage of dr. saeed ul hassan, is building a data analysing tool. this is a pioneering project launched to address the fact that research quality measurement models for the developing world need to be differentiated. the idea behind this project is that the identification of such research strengths will help institutes and universities in the developing world to strengthen their programs, focus on their strengths, improve their research profiles and be in a better position to apply for funding and research grants. the project is at an initial stage at the moment but it will eventually allow universities to compare their departmental and niche research strengths through various indicators and benchmark their research strengths with better analytical tools. the scope for this project will be global. opportunistic networks: challenges opportunities posted on: july 7th, 2014 by ituadmin no comments technological advances in communications technology over the past decade or so have rendered devices with sensing and computing ability, such as cell phones, affordable and widely available. this universality presents an interesting phenomenon known as opportunistic networks these are networks which are formed when devices come into contact opportunistically through physical proximity, and communicate wirelessly to share each other s content, resources and services. opportunistic networks very closely resemble social networks

they are primarily human centric for they come into being when humans come into contact. as marco conti and mohan kumar put it, opportunistic networks are tightly coupled with social networks and can exploit human relationships to build more efficient and trustworthy protocols. whereas human mobility in ad hoc networks is seen as problem, opportunistic networks in fact see at is a productive opportunity which can be exploited to forward data. with the pervasiveness of devices with built in wireless and wired technologies, the infrastructure for opportunistic networks is in place and has great potential. some of the most useful applications of opportunistic networks include establishing communication in situations wherein regular networks are disrupted such as in the case of natural disasters, emergencies or in far flung areas. however, there are no guarantees that data sent through opportunistic networks will reach the intended recipient, and a there may also be a great deal of delay. farah amjad, a research assistant at itu s trends technology and research in emerging networks and distributed systems lab is currently completing a paper in which she is identifying the main challenges which bar opportunistic networks from being more successful. among the challenges ms. amjad has identified in her paper is the problem of routing i.e. in opportunistic networks, routing algorithms have to provide reliability even if connectivity among nodes is intermittent or temporarily unavailable. another problem is that of increasing the efficiency of devices as the devices are small they don t have very long lasting batteries. similarly another issue is the due to high experimental cost most of mobility models are simulated and designed for small scale. to overcome this there is need to simulate mobility models on a large scale while considering real life mobility patterns. additionally, congestion is also a problem in opportunistic networks as the overflow of data exceeds the storage

and sending capacities of devices. ms. amjad has also highlighted the key challenges of security, privacy and trust in opportunistic networks as well as the fact that the nodes in opportunistic networks are often small devices functioning on low bandwidth and thus network protocols need to be designed accordingly. the future of opportunistic networks is extremely promising. ms. amjad s paper will make a significant contribution to the field by highlighting the need for networking solutions focussed on opportunistic networks. this paper will soon be sent for publication, and is being written under the supervision of itu faculty member and trends lab patron dr. adnan noor mian. fighting crime with data posted on: july 2nd, 2014 by ituadmin no comments using technology to make contemporary living easier and hassle free is a given, but what about using technology to prevent crime usman bukhary, an itu ms student and a research assistant at the business analytics lab bal , is currently using data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse data gathered on crimes taking place in the district of lahore. gis software and data mining technologies can help immensely in organizing data to build systems which can prove useful in improving efficiency and ensuring better resource utilization. in this case, bukhary is using data on crime to provide actionable feedback to local law enforcement agencies to help them improve crime prevention measures. data collected on crime from every thana police station in the seven divisions of the lahore district has been mapped and analysed in both spatial and temporal dimensions. it has been organized across different variables including the location, time and date at which crimes have taken place, and the type of crime. the results, including thematic maps, have yielded useful information for example, the cluster map below shows that crime takes place mostly on roads and public places in lahore. such information can be used to follow crime

patterns, which can be extremely helpful in the efficient deployment of personnel by law enforcement agencies. the map below shows areas where motorcycle thefts usually take place in the city. temporal data reveals that the probability of motorcycle theft in these areas is highest on tuesdays. police could easily use such information to ensure that appropriate and specialized preventive measures are taken to counter the type of crimes an area is most prone to at any given time. however, the data bukhary is working with at the moment comes exclusively from the police stationsof lahore and accounts only for reported crimes. this data very likely does not represent all the crimes which take place in the district. to make the system more comprehensive, bukhary plans on analysing information from social media platforms such as twitter. for example, if someone is robbed, they may not report it but if they publicly tweet about it, the information could be recorded in the database. this project is being supervised by itu faculty member and bal patron dr. faisal kamiran. research initiated in wireless sensor networks posted on: april 26th, 2014 by ituadmin no comments three postgraduate students at itu have initiated research in sensor networks in technology and research in emerging networks trends lab as part of their ms and phd theses requirements. under the supervision of itu faculty member dr. adnan noor mian, two ms students mohammed umer zahid and ali imran, are working on applied research on sensors while phd student raees khan is involved in developing protocols. umer zahid s research is geared towards developing a smart parking system wherein a mechanism could be developed to place sensors in parking lots which will be able to detect which lots have been filled and thereby allow for an efficient guiding system to be installed in parking lots. the most significant hurdle for zahid in this project is to evolve a cost effective system for this project using cheap, off

the shelf sensors and microcontroller board such as arduino board. it is also necessary that this system be energy efficient and so zahid is working to minimize the energy consumption of the system and looking to solve such problems as how to prolong the battery life of sensors so that they could run for years. ali imran is working to develop the coexistence of wireless lan and sensor network protocols. wireless lan technology works in the 2.4 ghz ism band, which requires no license for usage. most wireless technologies such as bluetooth networks, wireless mouse, wireless lans, etc. operates in this band. however, due to interference in the band, data loss often takes place. imran s research is to focus on ensuring that these different sensor network protocols work in harmony within the band with minimal interference and data loss. this research is being done in collaboration with the software house qairus. raees khan is doing his phd in developing transport layer protocols. reliability in transport networks is centred on source to destination routing through multi hop transmission. in end to end reliability systems, the destination sends back acknowledgement of the receipt of data to the source however, in these systems, intermediate nodes are not concerned with reliability. khan s research is focussed on implementing protocols to develop hop by hop reliability wherein intermediate nodes will also be involved in ensuring data reliability. collaboration of ctg with the health department posted on: april 21st, 2014 by ituadmin no comments although the punjab health department launched its expanded program on immunization epi in 1978 and aimed to wipe out or drastically reduce viral diseases for which vaccinations are available, every year thousands of children die or succumb to invalidity due to lack of access to or improper administration of basic vaccinations. polio, a viral disease which has been effectively eradicated in most of the world still persists in pakistan

and in fact, in december 2013, the polio virus was discovered thriving in lahore s sewage. additionally, as of april 2014, polio has also been declared on the rise in eight districts of punjab. in order to rectify this situation, wherein thousands are suffering needlessly from preventable diseases, the center for technology and governance at itu is now collaborating with the health department to chalk out a technological intervention which would help increase the effectiveness of the epi. using its mobile governance platform, ctg is developing a smart phone application which will aid the health department in monitoring the activities of field vaccination teams and thus ensure that vaccines are being properly administered. apart from enabling the effective monitoring of vaccination personnel, this application will also allow for the accumulation of a comprehensive database, which will include geo tagged photographic evidence of vaccinated children. mr. ali gibran, the program manager of ctg said that this is an exciting project which can potentially benefit millions of people. he said that ctg is currently in the process of developing this application, which will be ready in a week or two. once this is done, a pilot project will be launched in the district of lahore. in the future, it is hoped that this project will be expanded to cover the entire province. search for: pages about itu training library student societies about us academics academic calendar bachelors of science in management and technology bs m t bs electrical engineering executive mba emba fee structure forms and documents grading policy ms electrical engineering ms data science ms development studies: development, technology and policy programs course outline administration controller examination registrar team academics department admission department fm radio hr department it department library team media department student affairs web team registrar s office administration department treasurer s office

and passionate public service while rejuvenating the motivation and determination of public officials where they have been impaired by lack of resources or politicization. those who advocate citizen engagement celebrate its intrinsic and instrumental value. its intrinsic value is related to the concept of human capabilities put forward by nobel prize winner amartya sen, according to which citizen engagement gives people a voice in the development process and enables them to speak up against injustice and discrimination. it also contributes to people s well being and quality of life by fostering human capabilities and promoting fundamental freedoms. from an instrumental point of view, citizen engagement is endorsed as a means to attaining a variety of governance and development goals, such as lesser corruption, better public services, improved social capital etc. the way forward the inequalities that sideline the disadvantaged and the poor economically, socially and politically can also hinder their participation in the decision making process of the state. these inequities add to deformities in service delivery and encourage corruption and inefficiency thereby reducing trust in government. to conquer these challenges, a new route to public governance is needed in pakistan, a concept that goes beyond the bureaucratic norms of public administration and stretches out to citizens who offer resources for reconsidering their roles as members of the politic body. the pledges made to the sustainable development goals suggest that the world is at last awakening to the need to highlight good governance as the principal goal of all upcoming development. better governance is a pre requisite for, and perhaps also an outcome of, all efforts towards sustainability. citizen feedback monitoring program cfmp attempts to unpack and integrate the broad and unruly notions of governance and sustainable development to derive pathways to a more sustainable future for pakistan. any subsequent

efforts to instill good governance in pakistan must answer the following questions: how to best establish trust, participation, accountability and efficacy in public governance how to include opposing demands of different stakeholders, comprising local communities and businesses, so that they complement one another basically how to balance relations with the governance process how to institute interactive practices in societies to attain sustainable social economic, environmental and cultural development in accordance with the sdgs how to modify public administration from a sequestered techno bureaucratic institution to a more accountable and engaging citizen based institution, thereby making it more effective, transparent, responsive and most importantly trusted. this concept of public governance supports economic growth and emphasizes on an inclusive orientation in the framework of development. this orientation will be of no use unless public governance introduces processes that are instrumental to public policies to serve it. this requires building decision making procedures that are citizen based. the sdgs explicitly call for the establishment of good governance principles that are favorable to deepening democratic practices, that promote institutional means and options that authorize citizens so that they can be in control of their own matters. all in all, there is no denying that we are witnessing encouraging developments in ict enabled initiatives in harnessing public governance in pakistan. author sdgtechlab posted on december 9, 2019 december 13, 2019 categories blogs leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked comment name email website save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time i comment. sdg tech lab 2019 all rights reserved. sdg tech lab, information technology university, 6th floor, arfa software technology park, lahore, pakistan 09:00 am 5:00pm sdgtechlab@itu.edu.pk 042 111 111

that there have been voices against islam in the west for decades, and while commenting on muslim voices in the west he said that most muslim intellectuals in the west were driven away by repressive regimes and so, they are largely fanning the islamophobia in the west. therefore, he articulated a new way of dealing with the issue. challenging the current trend in the west dr weidner, who has published widely on arabic literature, spoke about his own journey and how he began to translate arabic literature in both german and english so that there is more interaction and understanding. he noted how scholarly voices do not have a wide reception in the public. there are voices like sipvak, bhabha, and others, but who knows them beyond a certain group he remarked. more concerted efforts therefore need to be undertaken he urged. cosmopolitanism, the best way to combat islamophobia, can only take root if we learn and read each other, he added. mr weidner underscored the importance of a broad based and encompassing culture where different traditions enrich each other and where there is a dialogue, respect and understanding. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore

read or write. polly is an interactive voice response ivr based entertainment service which also connects people to employment opportunities and facilitates them in developing a comfort level with technology. using a basic cell phone, any user could call a certain toll free number, record a message and send it on to five friends with five different kinds of voice manipulations. there are different voices for the interest of people and this aided users in using and exploring ivr technology. polly also gives its users the option to listen to jobs opportunities through their phones, and they could also share these with their friends. polly was launched in may 2012 and spread virally it soon reached 165,000 people and successfully engaged nearly 34,000 of them in browsing and sharing job and training opportunities. ctg s current project will redesign the scope of the polly project in order to ensure that it reaches out to a larger population than initially planned. based on the success of polly, this new project will work proactively to engage even more users, and link them to not only employment but also to skill development and vocational skills training opportunities through an integrated telephony web portal. the functions of recruitment, initial assessment and enrolment into employment and vocational training programs may also be carried out through this efficient and easily accessible telephone portal. in this sense, the portal will act just like an employment office only that it will be available via telephone and therefore will be easily accessible a vast majority of the population. the direct aim of this project is to empower marginalized, disabled and low literate segments of the society with a solution which will connect them directly to potential employers through their cell phones. mobile phone penetration in pakistan is approximately 74 , and it is estimated that 30 of the country s population is illiterate the definition of literacy here being the ability

to read a newspaper and write a simple letter . the ubiquitous usage of cell phones is being used by the project to facilitate such people. depending on a need assessment study being carried out, this project may also directly facilitate members of marginalized communities by distributing free vouchers for vocational training opportunities among them through the telephone portal with the view to empower them through skills training. employers and vocational training centres will also benefit from this project in two ways firstly, it will forge links between them and their target audiences, resulting in lower overhead costs. secondly, both employers and training centres will be guided to interact with target audiences optimally to further enhance their capacity building. this project is currently at the end of its planning stage, and shall be put into implementation next month. itu faculty member and co director of the innovations for poverty alleviation lab ipal samia razaq will be advising ctg on this project. ms. razaq was also among the developers of polly and has experience of developing technologies aimed at helping marginalized people. collaboration of itu with lahore transport company posted on: may 26th, 2014 by ituadmin no comments over half a million citizens of lahore use public transport daily to commute to and from their workplaces etc across the 1028 bus stops available in lahore. this great density of commuters faces various problems persistent uncertainty and the wastage of time are common as buses are often late, routes are arbitrarily altered, and there is no systematic way to access all the routes of the various public transport options along with their respective timings. looking to maximize ease and efficiency in the process commuting for citizens through a technological intervention, itu s center for technology and governance has signed a memorandum of understanding with the lahore transport company for a project named lahore in transit . the main

idea behind this project is to increase the reach of urban transport, and also help commuters save valuable time and energy by giving them access to reliable information about the transport system so they can plan their optimal routes. this exciting project is scheduled to be implemented in three phases. in the first phase, all the geographic data on local transport in lahore will be collected, digitized and uploaded on google transit, making lahore the first city in pakistan to become accessible through google transit. citizens can then avail the facility of entering their current location and intended destination on google maps and accessing the most relevant intra city public transport routes immediately including metro bus routes. in the second phase of the project, ltc s existing sms service which is currently a static service that only informs inquirers about routes will be optimized and become smart through the use of smart algorithms, which would enable commuters to plan their journey through a simple sms. an sms sent by the commuter with the names of the beginning and endpoint of her journey will be answered with information of all the optimal routes between these two points both in terms of least distance as well as least time. alongside, a dedicated smartphone application will also be developed for this purpose. the final phase of the project will oversee the designing and prototype development of low cost smart boards which will display the expected time of arrival of the next bus, to be installed at every bus stop at lahore. this will reduce uncertainty and increase reliability. not only will this project empower commuters and place lahore on the list of cities which use digital technology to facilitate its citizens, but it will also take a step towards nurturing the spirit of community activism and volunteerism among the youth as ctg will be using the help of student volunteers in the data collection and entry stages of the project. lahore in transit is

an excellent example of a project which highlights the fruitful cooperation between public institutions and academia. dr. umar saif, the vice chancellor of itu, and mr. khawaja haider latif, the ceo of lahore transport company signed the mou for this project on 21 st may. the point person on behalf of ctg for this project is mr. saad zulqernain, and the point person on part of ltc is mr. azhar hanif. collaboration of ctg with the health department posted on: april 21st, 2014 by ituadmin no comments although the punjab health department launched its expanded program on immunization epi in 1978 and aimed to wipe out or drastically reduce viral diseases for which vaccinations are available, every year thousands of children die or succumb to invalidity due to lack of access to or improper administration of basic vaccinations. polio, a viral disease which has been effectively eradicated in most of the world still persists in pakistan and in fact, in december 2013, the polio virus was discovered thriving in lahore s sewage. additionally, as of april 2014, polio has also been declared on the rise in eight districts of punjab. in order to rectify this situation, wherein thousands are suffering needlessly from preventable diseases, the center for technology and governance at itu is now collaborating with the health department to chalk out a technological intervention which would help increase the effectiveness of the epi. using its mobile governance platform, ctg is developing a smart phone application which will aid the health department in monitoring the activities of field vaccination teams and thus ensure that vaccines are being properly administered. apart from enabling the effective monitoring of vaccination personnel, this application will also allow for the accumulation of a comprehensive database, which will include geo tagged photographic evidence of vaccinated children. mr. ali gibran, the program manager of ctg said that this is an exciting project which can potentially

benefit millions of people. he said that ctg is currently in the process of developing this application, which will be ready in a week or two. once this is done, a pilot project will be launched in the district of lahore. in the future, it is hoped that this project will be expanded to cover the entire province. search for: pages about itu training library student societies about us academics academic calendar bachelors of science in management and technology bs m t bs electrical engineering executive mba emba fee structure forms and documents grading policy ms electrical engineering ms data science ms development studies: development, technology and policy programs course outline administration controller examination registrar team academics department admission department fm radio hr department it department library team media department student affairs web team registrar s office administration department treasurer s office admissions bs artificial intelligence bs ai bs computer engineering bs ce bs computer science bs cs bs economics with data science bs electrical engineering bs ee bs english with digital humanities bs management and technology bs m t bs software engineering bs se covid 19 admissions announcement eligibility criteria executive mba emba faqs ms computer engineering ms computer science ms data science ms development studies: development, technology and policy ms electrical engineering ms public policy and society norms criteria phd computer science phd electrical engineering phd admission test guidelines admissions 2 admissions open artbazaar bs computer engineering 1 st merit list 2021 bs computer engineering 1st merit list 2022 bs computer engineering 2 nd merit list 2021 bs computer engineering 2nd merit list 2022 bs computer engineering 3rd merit list 2022 bs computer engineering waiting list 2021 bs computer science clarification bs computer science 1 st merit list 2021 bs computer science 1st merit list 2022 bs computer science 2 nd merit list

based and filters densenet features using the ss net satellite segmentation network . the two different ways of adding attention is fully explained in the section 4 of our paper. initially the two bracnhes are trained separately and then merged together in the fusion net. the system diagram of ccpp, gwap and fusion net is shown below. dataset: we have collected a large dataset of diverse regions from around the globe. label for each image is total number of houses in it. the dataset can be download from here . ssnet: satellite segmentation network calculates per pixel probability for built up presence on an image. github repository: to download code and pre trained models for fusionnet, please visit our github repository . other links: you can find our publication here. bibtex: @article shakeel2019deep, title deep built structure counting in satellite imagery using attention based re weighting , author shakeel, anza and sultani, waqas and ali, mohsen , journal isprs journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing , volume 151 , pages 313 321 , year 2019 , publisher elsevier x previous next 2023 intelligence machine lab itu punjab

sdg tech lab supported by: home about overview history team projects current projects relevant experience of itu events inauguration of sdg tech lab sdg tech lab workshop media blogs partners contact us supported by: documenting firm level innovation in punjab s textile sector: how close is pakistan in achieving its 9th sustainable development goal while innovation can be a troubling concept in economics, its importance can not be overlooked. the ninth sustainable development goal is to improve innovation and infrastructure of the economy. our study documents firm level innovation in the textile sector of punjab, pakistan. in doing so, it aims to gauge how close pakistan is to realizing the ninth sustainable development goal. as pakistan s largest and most important export earner, the significance of the textile industry can not be understated. by studying private textile firms in punjab we were able to explore this sector through the lens of innovation at the firm level with the hopes of generating insights that can be translated into action at the firm level as well as in aid of macroeconomic policy. our data a unique data set of 180 observations was created and assembled by conducting detailed interviews with firm owners and managers, which were based on a structured survey. essentially, the survey aimed at documenting current barriers, r d and innovation practices from the start of fiscal year 2014 15 to the end of fiscal year 2016 17, alongside documenting managerial practices and environmental cost of production. firm classification the firms were divided across the three rungs of the value chain and by firm sizes within these firm types. the firm size is classified in terms of the persons labor employed such that: a medium sized firm employs between 20 99 persons a large sized firm: employs 100 or more persons when undeclared, the firm did not respond to the number of employees question table 1: author s own calculation geographical spread the sample was split

across the five major hubs of textile firms in punjab: table 2: author s own calculation figure 1: location of surveys in punjab product innovation product innovation is defined as the introduction of a good or service that is new to the market or is a significantly improved version of a current product. of the 180 firms studied, 39 reported to have conducted product innovation. figure 2: product innovation our study found that, on average, product innovation is responsible for more than a third of sales. table 3: author s own calculation why do firms conduct product innovation 84 of firms reported extending the range of goods and services being offered and opening new markets as the primary reason for innovating. in a way, this testifies to firms rationality and nullifies the neo classical notion of a firm engaged in the production of a homogenous product firms place importance on the notion of growth and are cognizant that consumer preferences evolve. firms decisions are demand driven rather than cost minimization. figure 3: reasons for being innovative product how do firms develop product innovation the more collaborative a sector is intra and inter the more innovative it is likely to be. while it is true that incremental innovations lead to radical innovation they are not the only way forward and the deeper the connection between industry and academia, the better are the chances of radical product innovation being developed. our study found that when it comes to production innovation, collaboration with academic and research institutes is nonexistent and, coupled with extremely high levels of in house research efforts, the needle on innovation does not move. this shows that the key stakeholders firms, academia and government are operating in silos. in particular, it seems that the relationship between firms and the government is parasitic and marred by suspicion while one reason for the high level of in house development is that firms have enough skilled labor on

their payroll. figure 4: collaborators for product innovation features of product innovation our study found that an equal amount of resources is directed to originating and adapting . this testifies to the incremental nature of innovation in the product sphere. our study also highlights the weakness of linkages in the product sphere and makes a case for more and meaningful collaborations between the key stakeholders. process innovation process innovation is defined as the implementation of a new or significantly improved production process, distribution method, or supporting activity. of the 180 observations, 51 of the firms reported to have conducted process innovation. figure 5: process innovation why do firms conduct process innovation our study found that in pakistan s textile sector, not only do more firms report conducting process innovation than product innovation, but the reasons for introducing process innovation are also more pronounced. the most prominent of these reasons is to improve the speed of production , which is in line with the fact that the highest proportion of firms conduct process innovation in the subcategory method of production. figure 6: reasons for being innovative process features of process innovation our study found that the most significant feature of, or motivation for, process innovation is the automation of manual processes and the use of more efficient technology. figure 7: features of process innovation how do firms develop process innovation our data shows a more collaborative stance taken by firms when it comes to process innovation, as compared to product innovation. this can be traced to a lesser prevalence of in house development of innovation and relatively stronger ties with other firms and organizations such that a substantial and majority of firms engage with each other constructively to exchange information. however, we found that professional organizations and associations like all pakistan textile mills association

aptma and local chambers of commerce, play a limited role in firms efforts to innovate which is rather alarming and needs be addressed in order to improve and increase process innovation. table 4: author s own calculation figure 8: collaborators for process innovation research development the existence of an r d department does not imply or guarantee higher levels of innovation, but it is a good starting point. we do not postulate a linear and clean relationship between innovation and research in fact, our data shows that a firm is not necessarily an innovator just by having an r d department. while the low r d budgets may seem to justify this, we suspect that cost is a feeble barrier to entry and the quality of research along with reported high levels of adaption may serve as better explanations for the low level of r d departments in this sector. figure 9: research and development department our study also deconstructed this relationship by profiling firms with r d departments and exploring the interaction between r d, innovation and exports. table 5: profiling firms with r d departments author s own calculation figure 10: interaction between r d, innovation and exports age size what types of firms are innovative age innovation: we divided firms in three classes of ages and found a substantial reduction in the number of innovating firms as the age increases and that the highest absolute number of innovators exist in the class of 21 40 years. figure 11: age and innovation size innovation: our study found a higher absolute number of innovators in large firms than in medium sized firms. it is important to note, however, that a higher number of firms are process rather than product innovators which is indicative of the fact that the nature of innovation in the textile sector is incremental. figure 12: firm size and innovation from a policy perspective, it appears that large sized firms between the ages of twenty one and forty could be the vehicle of change to make pakistani

textile firms more innovative. investment climate our study also chalks out the investment climate within this sector by exploring the various obstacles the firms face, as well as their severity. external finance our findings suggest that firms that are innovators and have formal r d departments as part of their organizational structure are less likely to face obstacles in obtaining external finance, which gives way to better chances of growth. table 6: author s own calculation competition national market 41 of our respondents identified the national market as the main market where they sold their goods and all of them faced competition. our study found that not only is the pakistani textile sector competitive, it also has a high prevalence of informal firms and operates at full capacity. competition international market 49 of our respondents identified the international market as their main market and all of them faced competition. 72 of these firms faced competition from informal firms and while we do not know whether competition was faced in the secondary market or in the international market, the latter would imply that informal and unregistered firms in pakistan are plugged into the international market. figure 13: degree of competition in national and international markets environmental cost at a time when pakistan s water scarcity is well established, our instrument is one of the first that asked firms about their precise water usage and discharge. we found that innovating firms use and discharge less water than non innovating firms and, therefore, can be key allies in mainstreaming responsible water use and conservation. figure 14: water used in production figure 15: water discharged in production exports obstacles to export the most severe obstacle to export is price competitiveness as pakistani exports face stiff competition from far asian substitutes. to counter this, there needs to be radical innovation in this sector firms needs to be more entrepreneurial

and need to climb up the value chain of textile, where price is a smaller concern. in addition, any government effort will not be enough to bring a sustained improvement unless it is matched with sustained efforts to innovate. table 7: author s own calculation figure 16: obstacles faced by exporting firms export destination pakistan was granted the generated system of preferences plus gsp by the eu in 2014 which resulted in a manifold increase in textile exports originating from pakistan and finding their way to europe. however, the growth of pakistani exports to the eu have stagnated. in addition, the cost of production in pakistan continues to rise and there is a swing in preferences for textile products that are ethically sourced and responsibly produced. so, pakistani exports have a market driven policy direction. as for china, it is advisable that pakistan revisit the terms afforded to textile exports originating from pakistan since some of the major exports do not get any concession at all for similar products, asean countries get duty free access while pakistan does not. figure 17: direct exports non exporting firms dynamism is important and while a firm that is an exporter is not automatically better than one that is a non exporter, for the purposes of this study, we assume that exporting firms are more dynamic than their non exporting counterparts. our study explored the reasons why firms choose not to export and also disaggregated these reasons according to the value chain of the pakistani textile sector. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such high resolution data has been collected and analyzed to study firm dynamism in pakistan. figure 18: reasons not to export table 8: author s own calculation current operations our study also explored the obstacles faced by textile firms in current operations. it is important to note that close to 30 of the firms identified access to production technology as a very severe obstacle while the availability

of skilled labor was not identified as an insurmountable obstacle. the most pressing obstacles were currency exchange rate and price increases of key inputs like fuel and electricity. table 9: author s own calculation figure 19: obstacles for firms current operations financing acquisition of fixed assets our study found firms to operate in line with the post keynesian theory of firm by protecting themselves from unnecessary exposure and resorting to the use of retained earnings and other internal funds to finance purchase of fixed assets than getting financing from banks. figure 20: financing fixed assets author: dr. izza aftab author dr. izza aftab posted on january 24, 2020 january 24, 2020 categories blogs leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked comment name email website save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time i comment. sdg tech lab 2019 all rights reserved. sdg tech lab, information technology university, 6th floor, arfa software technology park, lahore, pakistan 09:00 am 5:00pm sdgtechlab@itu.edu.pk 042 111 111 itu 488

the representation even when there are very few pixels belonging to the domain category small object for example compared to rest of the image.our multi level self supervised learning mlsl outperforms existing state of art self or adversarial learning algorithms. specifically, keeping all setting similar and employing mlsl we obtain an miou gain of 5.1 on gta v to cityscapes adaptation and 4.3 on synthia to cityscapes adaptation compared to existing state of art method. qualitative results: quantitative results: links: arxiv mlsl.pdf github mlsl domain adaptation for semantic segmentation: leaderboard github: leaderboard: domain adaptation for semantic segmentation you are welcomed to share your published results to be added to leaderboard. keywords: semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, self training, self supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation bibtex: @article iqbal2019mlsl, title mlsl: multi level self supervised learning for domain adaptation with spatially independent and semantically consistent labeling , author javed iqbal and mohsen ali , journal arxiv preprint arxiv:1909.13776 , year 2019 contact: javed.iqbal@itu.edu.pk x previous next 2023 intelligence machine lab itu punjab

that may prevent some demographics from participating. steadiness is cfmp financially and socially suitable in the long term risks and opportunity costs of engagement do benefits exceed costs strengthen and sustain is the initiative sustainable how do we measure sustainability what key factors affect it better governance is a pre requisite for, and perhaps an outcome of, all efforts towards sustainability. citizen feedback initiatives have the potential to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs in pakistan with their primary contribution to goal 16 , which is to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. goal 16 recognizes the centrality of effective, responsive and inclusive institutions to meeting societies aspirations for high quality public services that are accessible to all. with this focus and emphasis, sdg16 is a foundational condition for several other sdgs to be achieved and can be a key enabler for many others. hence, such initiatives are the need of the hour to drive pathways to a more sustainable future for all four provinces of pakistan. author sdgtechlab posted on december 24, 2019 december 24, 2019 categories blogs leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked comment name email website save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time i comment. sdg tech lab 2019 all rights reserved. sdg tech lab, information technology university, 6th floor, arfa software technology park, lahore, pakistan 09:00 am 5:00pm sdgtechlab@itu.edu.pk 042 111 111 itu 488

conference on design technology of integrated systems in nanoscale era dtis , april 12 14, 2016, istanbul, turkey! abstract: heterogeneous field programmable gate arrays fpgas are now considered as a practical alternative to application specific integrated circuits asics thanks to their generalized nature and fast time to market. however, the performance gap between fpgas and asics is still very significant, particularly in terms of area. in this work, we propose a novel heterogeneous fpga architecture based on memristor transistor hybrid approach that gives better results as compared to conventional transistor only heterogeneous fpga thus reducing the gap between fpgas and asics. memristor transistor based hybrid building blocks of heterogeneous fpga architecture are designed and simulated in this work. results show that hybrid blocks are 23 75 smaller compared to transistor only blocks. furthermore, a generalized exploration flow is also developed where a combination of open source and indigenously developed tools gives end to end exploration experience. in the experiments, we have demonstrated the placement and routing of at least 10 different heterogeneous benchmarks on proposed hybrid as well as conventional heterogeneous fpgas using the exploration flow. results show that proposed hybrid architecture, on average, consumes 56 less logic area, 60 less routing area thus leading to 59 total area gain compared to conventional architecture. salman taha joins eclab for ms thesis! salman taha, student of ms in computer science batch 2014 at itu, has joined eclab for his ms thesis on secure and dynamic application deployment in many core architecture under the supervision of dr. khurram bhatti. the research work carried out in his thesis will contribute to the tsunamy project. salman taha did bachelor s in electrical engineering from uet, lahore in 2012 with minor in computer engineering. he has over 3 years of experience of working in software industry. he is currently

the pakistan then created by this muslim salariat emerged out of a minority rights discourse, and focused on a broad rights based platform. in his talk, dr samad emphasized that state and nation building was not easy, but that whatever the solution, it has to come through an engaged citizenship process. citizens of the nation cannot be passive observers in their country, or else the state will be taken over by a few and the nation building process compromised. he argued that there are only two ways of dealing with difference: killing all those who disagree, or negotiating a solution with them. he noted that in the west a number of states have been built on the notion of killing all dissenters, ethnic cleansing, pogroms and holocausts however, real solutions only emerge through dialogue and discourse. pakistan has already gone through one bloody and painful division, and so the time has come for us to negotiate our mutual existence and shun the way of violence to achieve national unity. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

for they come into being when humans come into contact. as marco conti and mohan kumar put it, opportunistic networks are tightly coupled with social networks and can exploit human relationships to build more efficient and trustworthy protocols. whereas human mobility in ad hoc networks is seen as problem, opportunistic networks in fact see at is a productive opportunity which can be exploited to forward data. with the pervasiveness of devices with built in wireless and wired technologies, the infrastructure for opportunistic networks is in place and has great potential. some of the most useful applications of opportunistic networks include establishing communication in situations wherein regular networks are disrupted such as in the case of natural disasters, emergencies or in far flung areas. however, there are no guarantees that data sent through opportunistic networks will reach the intended recipient, and a there may also be a great deal of delay. farah amjad, a research assistant at itu s trends technology and research in emerging networks and distributed systems lab is currently completing a paper in which she is identifying the main challenges which bar opportunistic networks from being more successful. among the challenges ms. amjad has identified in her paper is the problem of routing i.e. in opportunistic networks, routing algorithms have to provide reliability even if connectivity among nodes is intermittent or temporarily unavailable. another problem is that of increasing the efficiency of devices as the devices are small they don t have very long lasting batteries. similarly another issue is the due to high experimental cost most of mobility models are simulated and designed for small scale. to overcome this there is need to simulate mobility models on a large scale while considering real life mobility patterns. additionally, congestion is also a problem in opportunistic networks as the overflow of data exceeds the storage and sending capacities of devices.

ms. amjad has also highlighted the key challenges of security, privacy and trust in opportunistic networks as well as the fact that the nodes in opportunistic networks are often small devices functioning on low bandwidth and thus network protocols need to be designed accordingly. the future of opportunistic networks is extremely promising. ms. amjad s paper will make a significant contribution to the field by highlighting the need for networking solutions focussed on opportunistic networks. this paper will soon be sent for publication, and is being written under the supervision of itu faculty member and trends lab patron dr. adnan noor mian. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

great endeavor of developing a new paradigm for the subject. in this historic juncture, the aim of an undergraduate programme in economics should be to combine rigorous training in mainstream economics with data science together with exposure to a wide range of fields in the social sciences and humanities. through such multidisciplinary training around hardcore economics, the students can be stimulated to form connections across subjects in addressing the central challenges that impact society, economy and polity. students of economics can thereby participate in the exciting venture of transforming the economics paradigm and help build a better future for the human community. the undergraduate programme in economics with data science has been designed with this aim in view. rigorous training is provided in economics through courses such as macroeconomics, microeconomics, mathematics, econometrics, international trade and finance. emerging fields in economics are also included in the programme. for example, the new political economy, sustainable development, evidence based design of policy for urban and rural development. a key dimension in the economics programme is data science which has two components: i big data techniques and ii machine learning. this relatively new field is becoming increasingly important in the design of projects and policies. this corpus of courses in economics and data science is combined with courses in the fields of philosophy, politics and literature. it is hoped that systematic training in economics and data science, combined with a broad understanding of social sciences and humanities, will equip students to contribute to research and policy thinking. they will thus be able to participate in the process of developing a new paradigm in economics and building a better world. eligibility criteria admission test fee structure program structure eligibility criteria who can apply applicants who have completed 12 years of education, or will do

creativity. this learning transforms its students into least productive components of the socio economic engine. in contrast, education through analyzing and understanding accentuates creativity, which is an important human resource. thinking of possible solutions to it introduced him to the world of artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks. biography mr. usama s interest in computers and digital gadgets was cultivated at an early stage by the considerable encouragement of his father. he is an architect and allowed mr. usama to experiment with the hardware and software of personal computers at his firm. technology was an emerging trend in his third world country, with struggling middle class families striving to get a grip on it. he is guilty of forcefully inserting rams into a system in the opposite direction and getting it burnt. through the endless support of his family and academic trials and errors, he managed to complete his undergrad in computer engineering from the national university of computer and emerging sciences. his perseverance and passion for the subject led him to academic success of winning a gold medal in computer engineering. he was on the dean merit list every semester in his undergrad and scored a cgpa of 4.0 during his masters in computer sciences. he managed to maintain his performance in master s as well and was on the dean merit list for all four semesters. managing challenges and resolving complex problems is his forte. x previous next recent publications awards honors gold medal in bs computer engineering gold medal in masters in computer science affiliations students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development

including the punjab bloodied , partitioned and cleansed: unravelling the 1947 tragedy through secret british reports and first person accounts . during his talk, dr. ahmed gave a balanced view of the partition and the events leading up to it. dr. ishtiaq ahmed discussed in detail the fight between muslims, hindus and sikhs over the punjab of british india, which held religious and cultural significance for all of them. he gave examples from his book and recounted interviews from survivors and eyewitnesses of 1947. he mentioned an eyewitness account, which stated that at the muharram iglas rally , usually muslim and hindu communities used to walk together. however, at the turn of the 20th century, the nationalist wave started sweeping through india. it also affected punjab and religious revivals began there. muslims and hindus who previously used to live together and share culture and space were forced to set up categories. dr. ishtiaq ahmed mentioned that punjab is a by product of the partition of british india and perhaps, without violence there would have been no partition at all. the widespread violence occurred because demonization and dehumanization of the other started taking place. dr. ahmed also declared, don t run down gandhi. he had a lot of flaws but at the end of the day, he was one of the biggest benefactors of muslims. dr. ahmed discussed the partition in terms of human rights, ethnic cleansing and nationalism. he talked about the boundary issues of pakistan during partition and addressed the famous controversy that lord mountbatten had favored the national congress over boundary demarcations. he said that the radcliffe award was not unfair and it had supported the pakistani position. he commented that the radcliffe award was remarkably similar to the 7th may wavell demarcation document with one minor change. mountbatten had noticed that on the original wavell document, amritsar was on its own and indefensible as it jutted out on muslim majority areas

so he gave india the area of gurdaspur as well. dr. ishtiaq commented, whether he did this for the indian national congress or not we will never know. history can only speculate. dr. ishtiaq has addressed this controversy more fully in his book. dr. ishtiaq encouraged questions from the audience and he answered several interesting questions including what would have been a more peaceful means of partition. answering this question, he said that the british had to leave india. after the second world war, they were bankrupt and they could not afford to pay their troops any longer but the partition could have been done more peacefully. dr. ahmed had found records that show that the governor of punjab had requested 20,000 british troops at that time to manage the partition peacefully but he had been given none. he just had the punjab boundary troops and they were both under armed and under manned. overall, it was a bad position to be in. the lecture was widely attended by faculty and students. at the end of the event, dr. nizamuddin, chairman of the punjab higher education commission, and dr. yaqoob khan bangesh, director of the centre for governance and policy, presented him with a shield of appreciation for his talk and amjad saleemi, treasurer of itu, gave him a gift on behalf of the university. dr. ishtiaq also invited students to the launch of the urdu translation of his new book punjab ka batwara: aik almiya hazaar dastaaney at the lahore press club. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer

results show total publication output during 2009 2014 and their proportion in top quality venues. the results are sorted based the volume of publications in core a and a venues. overall rating: the overall rating provides a measure of the comprehensiveness of research strengths across the 27 level 1 categories and is a good starting point for a university to quickly identify broad areas of strength or weakness, which can then be further investigated using the subject rating and benchmarking functions in progress . the overall score is computed by taking the average of high quality publications at level 1 research active subject discipline. an institute is considered research active if it has more than 40 publications in a given discipline in 6 years time window. the large size institutes, which are research active in more than ten level 1 disciplines, are grouped as breadth comprehensive, whereas, the medium or small size institutes are grouped as depth comprehensive. the institutes with more than 4 research active areas are included in overall rating. in interpreting these results it is important to note that although a university may not appear strong in a broad subject area, it may still have significant strength in a narrower sub area. this can be investigated by drilling down to sub areas with the subject area rating function. future extensions interdisciplinary areas initial work will focus on including interdisciplinary areas such as ict4d and its sub areas. the keyword based approach will be used to procure publications classified under interdisciplinary fields hassan haddawy, 2013 . benchmarking while the initial release of the itu research rankings focuses on research benchmarking and within that on use of bibliometrics, we recognize that this evaluates only part of one dimension of the diverse mission of universities. the itu research rankings will work toward broader measures for research benchmarking, including detailed funding information, commercialization,

and societal impact. longer term the initiative will also seek to address benchmarking of education and outreach activities. close overall rating: broad institutions close close overall rating: specialized institutions close university rating independent intellectual creative capacity developed through research is essential in enabling countries to take control of exploring, planning, and implementing their own most appropriate sustainable development paths. given the scarce financial resources in many countries, areas of research focus must be carefully chosen so as to achieve maximum value from investment at a level that will have noticeable positive impact upon society. in pursuit of its core objectives to study the scientific and academic research from a scientific point of view the dynamics of scientific research and its connections to technology, innovation and society through the use of bibliometric indices and other innovation strategies, itu's scientometrics lab has been working on several research projects. among these programs, a key project is the itu research rankings, which is intended to provide objective data and analyses to benchmark research performance in traditional disciplinary subject areas and in interdisciplinary areas for the purpose of strengthening the quality and impact of research. the itu research rankings supports universities to determine their own research profile and identify niche areas in which they can excel to make more rational strategic and resource allocation decisions and to publicize program strengths. tweets by @iturankings copy 2016 itu research ranking all right reserved.

technological intervention, itu s center for technology and governance has signed a memorandum of understanding with the lahore transport company for a project named lahore in transit . the main idea behind this project is to increase the reach of urban transport, and also help commuters save valuable time and energy by giving them access to reliable information about the transport system so they can plan their optimal routes. this exciting project is scheduled to be implemented in three phases. in the first phase, all the geographic data on local transport in lahore will be collected, digitized and uploaded on google transit, making lahore the first city in pakistan to become accessible through google transit. citizens can then avail the facility of entering their current location and intended destination on google maps and accessing the most relevant intra city public transport routes immediately including metro bus routes. in the second phase of the project, ltc s existing sms service which is currently a static service that only informs inquirers about routes will be optimized and become smart through the use of smart algorithms, which would enable commuters to plan their journey through a simple sms. an sms sent by the commuter with the names of the beginning and endpoint of her journey will be answered with information of all the optimal routes between these two points both in terms of least distance as well as least time. alongside, a dedicated smartphone application will also be developed for this purpose. the final phase of the project will oversee the designing and prototype development of low cost smart boards which will display the expected time of arrival of the next bus, to be installed at every bus stop at lahore. this will reduce uncertainty and increase reliability. not only will this project empower commuters and place lahore on the list of cities which use digital technology to facilitate its citizens, but it will also take a step towards nurturing

the spirit of community activism and volunteerism among the youth as ctg will be using the help of student volunteers in the data collection and entry stages of the project. lahore in transit is an excellent example of a project which highlights the fruitful cooperation between public institutions and academia. dr. umar saif, the vice chancellor of itu, and mr. khawaja haider latif, the ceo of lahore transport company signed the mou for this project on 21 st may. the point person on behalf of ctg for this project is mr. saad zulqernain, and the point person on part of ltc is mr. azhar hanif. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

ground truth information of the target domain. on the other hand, due to the lack of strong spatial context and structure, in comparison to the ground imagery, application of existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods results in the sub optimal adaptation. we thoroughly study limitations of existing domain adaptation methods and propose a weakly supervised adaptation strategy where we assume image level labels are available for the target domain. more specifically, we design a built up area segmentation network as encoder decoder ,with image classification head added to guide the adaptation. the devised system is able to address the problem of visual differences in multiple satellite and aerial imagery datasets, ranging from high resolution hr to very high resolution vhr , by investigating the latent space as well as the structured output space. a realistic and challenging hr dataset is created by hand tagging the 73.4 sq km of rwanda, capturing a variety of build up structures over different terrain. the developed dataset is spatially rich compared to existing datasets and covers diverse built up scenarios including built up areas in forests and deserts, mud houses, tin and colored rooftops. extensive experiments are performed by adapting from the single source domain datasets, such as massachusetts buildings dataset, to segment out the target domain. we achieve high gains ranging 11.6 52 in iou over the existing state of the art methods. the figure demonstrates the proposed lt wan architecture for built up regions segmentation. a fully convolutional discriminator network is trained using x g. the segmentation network is optimized with l adv loss from discriminator network in latent space,l seg loss in output space and l h d loss in both latentand output space. rwanda built up region segmentation dataset: we create rwanda built up regions dataset, a different and versatile in nature from previously available datasets. the varying structure size and formation,

irregular patterns of construction, buildings in forests and deserts, and the existence of mud houses makes it very challenging. a total of 787 satellite images of size 256 256 are collected at high resolution hr of 1.193 meter per pixel and hand tagged for built up region segmentation using an online tool label box. the difference between rwanda images and other existing datasets images is shown in fig. 1 which makes it very challenging for an adaptation algorithm. the variations in visual appearances and terrain are successfully captured by our proposed adaptation method as shown in table and images below. qualitative results: output of built up area segmentation when adapted from massachusetts to village finder, potsdam and rwanda datasets respectively. columns from left to right represent target image, ground truth, source only, osa: output space adaptation tsai et al., 2018 , lta: latent space adaptation chen et al., 2017 benjdira et al., 2019 , os wan and lt wan respectively. the proposed lt wan and os wan mitigates the false segmentation posed by osa and lsa and improves the true positive rate significantly quantitative results: links: pdf: weakly supervised domain adaptation for built up region segmentation github: weakly supervised adaptation network dataset: rwanda built up region segmentation dataset keywords: semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, weakly supervised domain adaptation, satellite imagery, remote sensing bibtex: @article iqbal2020weakly, title weakly supervised domain adaptation for built up region segmentation in aerial and satellite imagery , author iqbal, javed and ali, mohsen , journal isprs journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing , volume 167 , pages 263 275 , year 2020 , publisher elsevier contact: javed.iqbal@itu.edu.pk x previous next 2023 intelligence machine lab itu punjab

after dipping our toes in deep belief networks and recurrent neural network we will start looking into applications of deep learning in three different areas, text analysis, speech processing and computer vision. objective of this approach is to make you comfortable enough that you can understand various research problems and, if interested, can implement deep learning based applications. course objectives in last few years machine learning has matured from the science fiction to reality. we are living in a world where we have already seen industry bringing to reality self driving cars, face recognizers that work on massive scale facebook , speech translation systems that can translate from one language to many other simultaneously and in real time, and more interestingly we have machines that can learn to play atari games in a similar fashion like we do. a lot of these victories have come from the exciting field of deep learning a learning methodology based on the concept that human mind captures details at multiple levels or at multiple abstract levels. one property of deep learning is removing the responsibility of humans to design features, instead deep learning is given a task to find the appropriate representation. grading policy 50 assignments 15 final project 15 quizzes 10 midterm exam 10 final exam honor code all cases of academic misconduct will be forwarded to the disciplinary committee. all assignments are group based unless explicitly specified by the instructor. in the words of efros,let s not embarrass ourselves. tentative and rough course outline weeks topics evaluations 1 introduction to deep learning difference between machine learning and deep learning basic machine learning: linear logistic regression, 2 supervised learning with neural networks deep learning, single and multi layer neural networks, perceptron rule, gradient descent, backpropagation, loss functions tutorial 1: python numpy tutorial assignment 1 1 hyperparameters tuning, regularization

affairs. afghanistan is not an easy country to keep up with, said ahmed rashid. he termed afghanistan as an ethnic mosaic and a resilient nation that has withstood immense pressure from communist systems, civil war and breakdown of ethnic barriers for more than 250 years. he also broached the taliban issue in pakistan and afghanistan. he talked about how the taliban came into being in afghanistan and then re emerged in 2003 with the taliban leadership becoming firmly established in the northern regions of pakistan. he maintained that unlike the pakistani taliban, the afghan taliban were a cohesive group. the increasing popularity of the taliban in afghanistan coupled with the inefficiency and rapidly declining popularity of the current government was a grave cause of concern. mr. ahmed rashid said that very soon the afghan taliban will simply lose interest in holding talks with the government and simply wait till a time that they can take over afghanistan again. this of course would not bode well for pakistan or china. china has expressed interest in helping out afghanistan. it might be better for their national interests if the taliban regime ends and this radicalization doesn t reach the large muslim population in china. on the other hand, pakistan needs to maintain a strict no tolerance policy. mr. ahmed rashid lamented the fact that the national action plan, agreed upon by all the parties in pakistan after much deliberation, is merely a paper now with no talk of its implementation. he stated that afghanistan s neighbours have always had vested interests in her affairs and had made long efforts to assert dominance in the country so the best policy for afghanistan at the moment, would be a regional consensus for non interference by its neighbouring countries until matters are fully resolved. there was active participation by both faculty and students during the question answer session. during the course of the discussion, mr. ahmed rashid helped deconstruct some of

the conspiracy theories brought up by the students. no subject has been more full of lies and conspiracy theories, he maintained. he encouraged students to avoid the web of conspiracy and deceit that surrounds this topic and only look at facts and irrefutable data to form their opinion. this event was well attended by students and faculty alike. at the end of the talk, dr. nizamuddin, chairman of punjab higher education commission, presented mr. ahmed rashid with a shield in appreciation of his brilliant talk and the director of the centre, dr. yaqoob khan bangash, gave him a copy of his new book a princely affair. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488

from appropriate current voltage data plot. by applying this model to experimental data, the standard field emission parameters can be deduced with better accuracy than by using the conventional fn equation. download pdf quick links home publications contact us faculty profile: dr. muhammad qasim mehmood faculty profile: dr. muhammad zubair faculty profile: dr. kashif riaz useful links metamaterials plasmonic research laboratory prof. ricky ang's group sutd singapore prof. shuang zhang university of birmingham rice online learning spietv prof. v. shalaev purdue university socialize 2019 information technology university, government of the punjab powered by: information technology university

crowdsourcing solutions, flood surveillance systems, safety add on for machinery and tech based mobility aid for the visually impaired. the presenters received critique, encouragement and suggestions from an esteemed panel of judges including gwendolyn kulick from beaconhouse national university, mustafa naseem from ipal and saad idrees from the world bank. the first project titled let s help came up with a crowd funding solution that makes use of cell phones and mobile apps. the aim of the presenters was to find the easiest way of donating money to boost fundraising performance. they came to the conclusion that there was no trend of donating money either online or through a mobile app in pakistan, so they came up with the idea for let s help to address this problem. another project focused on using innovative products to create an injury free environment for workers. according to a recent survey, workers in the agricultural sector receive the most significant injuries including amputations, electrocutions and even death. the startup called mecasafe: makers of safety add on s for perilous ag tech invented a safety add on for chaff cutting machines. mecasafe came up with a hand detection system that can be attached to most chaff machines. if a hand comes too close to the sharp blades, then the add on detects the hand, applies the brakes and turns the chaff cutting machine off immediately to prevent amputation of limbs. this startup has no direct competitors in the market at the moment and has addressed a pressing concern in the workforce. a hand detection system, like the one mecasafe has come up with can prevent injuries and save the lives of the workforce, especially of those living in developing countries with poor healthcare. another group presented their work on navcane : tech based mobility aid for the visually impaired. this is going to be the first product of its kind in pakistan and their aim is to improve the lives of the visually impaired one step at a time.

navcane is an attachment to a white cane that can guide the visually impaired in navigation. this attachment has two features: obstacle detection and direction finder. navcane s closest competitors are companies based in india and the united kingdom but navcane provides more features at a lower cost. this product has the potential to have a tremendous impact on the lives of the visually impaired living in pakistan and it has paired up with the pakistan association of the blind. the last presentation was on aqua eye: flood surveillance system . pakistan has suffered catastrophic damage from floods in recent years and there is a lack of an early warning system. the existing sonar system cost around 380 million rupees and it is only present in 13 locations at the moment. the presenters highlighted how the existing manual systems don t work so their flood surveillance system would not only remove human error but it would also provide accurate warning to pakistani citizens through sms. the judges examined the working prototypes of each project and provided helpful, constructive feedback. the event was well attended by students, academics and industry professionals. x previous next students news grading policy forms documents library resources programs offered campus life admissions trainings short courses bs economics with data science bs english with digital humanities bs management technology bs computer engineering bs electrical engineering bs computer science bs software engineering bs artificial intelligence executive mba emba ms development studies ms public policy and society ms data science ms computer science ms electrical engineering ms computer engineering phd computer science phd electrical engineering fee structure scholarships university about jobs openings student services placement office sspo research centres faculty tenders rti newsletter subscription subscribe to keep yourself updated with the latest news happenings itu admissions office 6th floor, arfa software technology park, ferozepur road, lahore e admission@itu.edu.pk admission queries 042 99046061 0307 0111488 uan 042 111 111 itu 488
